![App Main Layout](https://i.imgur.com/vEVwqVgl.jpg)

An app with a blank canvas, where you can put your creative skills to use. You can convert handwritten text to printed text too.
The main project structure for the canvas part is taken from chapter 5 of 'Android 6 for Programmers'<sup> [1]</sup>. The integration of Tesseract OCR Engine<sup> [2]</sup> was done following the guidelines of this [tutorial](http://imperialsoup.com/2016/04/29/simple-ocr-android-app-using-tesseract-tutorial/)<sup> [3]</sup>.
